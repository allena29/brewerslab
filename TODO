* Convert brewday pages over to newer process.py type format.
  - better to build the full page rather than trying to manage the AJAX stuff dynamically.

* Add alternatives for Hops
* Add scale recipe to editRecipe
* Add change process to editRecipe
* Add ingredient page
* Add HLT delay
* CRS Calcultion doesn't take recipe alkalinity required into account

* Add efficiency
80% FGDB x 46 = 37 PPG
If 4% moisture => 76.8% FGAI x 46 = 35 PPG
If F/C = 2%, => 74.8% CGAI x 46 = 34 PPG 	
Efficiency is usually quoted with respect to %Extract FGDB. (ex. 37 PPG)
If you get 7 gallons of 1.038 from 9.5 lbs grain after mashing & lautering (ex. 7.38/9.5=28 PPG), then 28/37 = 76% Efficiency
