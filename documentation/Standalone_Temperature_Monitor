A slave can be modified into a standalone temperature monitor, with 
self serving web-pages over WIFI (i.e. smartphone)

In addition remote-access is possible, however the networking requirements
are not covered here except for port-forwarding TCP Port 54661 to either 
the wifi or ethernet address.

There is no support this time for joining the WIFI to an existing WIFI network
although this is just a case of providing the appropriate wpa_supplicant config
and disabling the dhcp server.




set static address for wireless in /etc/dhcpcd.conf
                interface wlan0
                 static ip_address=172.12.12.122/25


sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
update-rc.d isc-dhcp-server disable


remove references to wpa-supplicant in /etc/network/interfaces


add dhcpd range in config

subnet 172.12.12.0 netmask 255.255.255.128 {
  range 172.12.12.12 172.12.12.120;
}
