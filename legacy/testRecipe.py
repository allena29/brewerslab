# Bottling Day

# Empty the wort into the fermentation bin:sp
# 
# Empty Wort into the brewing 

#step.attention="temperature may need to be raised >82degC depending on the loss so that the grain bed is 73 degC. The water in the ATC800 is set to 82... initial plan was 77degC. JBK thread recommends 85degC plus monitoring. will go for 82 for now"

#Continuous Sparging usually results in better extractions. The wort is re-circulated and drained until about an inch of wort remains above the grain bed. The sparge water is gently added, as necessary, to keep the fluid at least at that level. The goal is to gradually replace the wort with the water, stopping the sparge when the gravity is 1.008 or when enough wort has been collected, whichever comes first. This method demands more attention by the brewer, but can produce a higher yield.
